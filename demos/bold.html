            <b>Association football</b> is a sport played between two teams. It is usually called <b>football</b>, but in
            some countries, such as the United States, it is called <b>soccer</b>. In
            <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a>, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, Canada and
            Republic of Ireland, both words are commonly used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each team has 11 players on the field. One of these players is the <i>goalkeeper</i>, and the other ten are
            known as <i>"outfield players."</i> The game is played by <b>kicking a ball into the opponent's goal</b>. A
            match has 90 minutes of play, with a break of 15 minutes in the middle. The break in the middle is called
            half-time.

            There are many competitions for football, for both football clubs and countries. Football clubs usually play
            other teams in their own country, with a few exceptions. <b>Cardiff City F.C.</b> from Wales for example, play
            in the English leagues and in the English FA Cup.
        </p>
        <h2>Who plays football <span class="smaller">(this section is editable and in pre-formatted text)</span></h2>
        <pre contenteditable="true">
Football is the world's most popular sport. It is played in more
countries than any other game. In fact, FIFA (the Federation
Internationale de Football Association) has more members than the
United Nations.

It is played by both males and females.
